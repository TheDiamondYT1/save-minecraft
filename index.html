				<p style="text-align: left;">Save Minecraft is a movement against the large changes in the Bedrock Engine from the other console editions.<br />
				
				<p>To help achieve complete unity between the legacy console editions and the new Bedrock Engine, you can <a class="externalLink" href="http://saveminecraft.tk/get-involved/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">upvote the feature requests</a>.<br />
				  We do currently support upvoting feature requests, but soon will release resources to enhance your Minecraft experience. One of these resources will be a resource pack to contain the legacy textures.
				</p>
				<h1 style="text-align: center;">Why is this a problem?</h1>
				<p>
				  If you went down to your local McDonalds, and there was a big poster saying that no new recipes was going to be sold here, and to go to their new store round the corner. In this store you two floors housing nice, clean seating with beautiful views of the ocean out the window. It also had nice air conditioning. However the new store sold new recipes so you always had something new to try. It had nice seating, but only one floor. And no air conditioning apart from a small fan in the corner. Your view out the window was the plain back wall of pub.
				  <br><br>
				  <strong>Which would you choose?</strong>
				  <br><br>
				  This is exactly the problem with Minecraft. The classic console version is very stable and works great with controllers, as well as having a well designed crafting interface and easily accesible host options, but will no longer receive another new updates. However, the new version will get many new updates while not feeling as nice as the classic version, and doesn't include minigames (well, not like they were implemented in the classic console edition).
				</p>
				<h1 style="text-align: center;">Help get these features implemented!</h1>
